# Creating a texture array from a GIF

- Install the [UnityTexture2DArrayImportPipeline](https://github.com/pschraut/UnityTexture2DArrayImportPipeline).
    - This is very important if you want your texture array to be imported properly on Android (Quest), most other tools will not re-import the proper format for Android and cause more VRAM usage.
- Use FFmpeg to create PNGs from a GIF `ffmpeg -i your_file.gif -vsync 0 frame%d.png`.
- Import the created PNGs in Unity and add them to a new texture array `Create > Texture2DArray` (You can lock the inspector and drag them all in at once).
- You can use texture arrays with the `Lit Variants/Screen` shader
